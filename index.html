    Demo of all our favorite Bulma aspects.

    If you're reading this, and you're learning Bulma,
    then you probably want to first read the individual
    files in this same repository directory that are about
    one topic each, such as a navbar, panel, tab, footer, etc.

    This HTML demo also annotates typical web page features,
    such as meta tags, that you may want to use on your own pages.

  <head>

    <!-- Use UTF-8 character encoding. -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">

    <!-- Bulma needs a responsive viewport meta tag. -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <!-- Use any title you want. -->
    <title>Petre cu Triumph</title>

    <!-- Use Bulma by fetching the file via CDN; if you prefer, you can download Bulma. -->

      ## Navigation JavaScript ##
      
      The Bulma package does not come with any JavaScript.
      Here is a demo implementation example, which toggles the navigation bar
      class `is-active` on both the navbar-burger and the targeted navbar-menu.

    <!-- 
      ## Font Awesome ##

      We want to use Font Awesome icons with Bulma, so we load them here.
      This is optional. Feel free to skip using icons, or to use your own.

      ## X-UA-Compatible ##

      Microsoft Internet Explorer compatibility tag. Microsoft writes:
      If you are using the X-UA-Compatible META tag you want to place 
      it as close to the top of the page's HEAD as possible. 
      
      Internet Explorer begins interpreting markup using the latest version. 
      When Internet Explorer encounters the X-UA-Compatible META tag it 
      starts over using the designated version's engine. This is a performance 
      hit because the browser must stop and restart analyzing the content.

      IE11 has made changes to these modes. Microsoft Edge, the browser that 
      replaced IE11, only honors the tag in certain circumstances. 
      
      If you need to support IE9 or IE8, then we recommend using the tag. 
      If you only support the latest browsers (IE11 and/or Edge) then 
      consider dropping this tag altogether. If you use Twitter Bootstrap 
      and need to eliminate validation warnings, this tag must appear in 
      its specified order.
    --> 
    <meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">

    <!--
      ## Theme color ##

      Starting in version 39 of Chrome for Android on Lollipop, you'll now 
      be able to use the theme-color meta tag to set the toolbar color.
    -->
    <meta name='theme-color' content='#aa1e1e'>

    <!--
      ## Application name ##

      According to HTML5 LC, a meta tag with name=application-name shall have 
      value (in the content attribute) that is “short free-form string giving 
      the name of the Web application that the page represents”; if the page 
      is not an application, such a tag must not be used. Browsers “may use 
      the application name in UI in preference to the page's title, since the
      title might include status messages and the like relevant to the status
      of the page at a particular moment in time instead of just being the 
      name of the application.
    -->
    <meta name="application-name" content="Demo App Name"/>
